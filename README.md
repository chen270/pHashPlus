A Perceptual Hashing C++ Library.

The project is mainly sponsored by
1. https://github.com/aetilius/pHash
2. https://www.phash.org/releases/pHash-0.9.6.tar.gz
3. https://github.com/starkdg/phash
4. https://cimg.eu/

The audiophash, cimgffmpeg, ph_fft and win folders are composed by the pHash git.
CIMG.h is from the CIMG official website.
The pHash.h and pHash.cpp files are from pHash-0.9.6.tar.gz because I need pthread multi-thread support.
Bmbhash is modified from starkdg-phash.
